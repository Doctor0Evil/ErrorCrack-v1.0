### ALN Standard Directory Structure Overview

The **ALN (Alien-Language-Network)** framework adopts a modular source-code and asset hierarchy that optimizes for scalability, agent interoperability, and continuous deployment across distributed platforms. The structure prioritizes separation of concerns, version consistency, and agent-driven workflows as defined in *Agents.md* standards.

### Core Directories

| Directory | Purpose / Contents |
|------------|--------------------|
| `/src/aln_cli` | Contains CLI tools, ALN-specific command-line parsers, and related interface scripts. Enables direct interaction for agent developers and admins. |
| `/src/deployment` | Holds Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and orchestration logic for platform deployments and containerized infrastructures. |
| `/src/embedding_models` | Integration points for deep-learning embedding models (e.g., MiniLM, Llama derivatives) and RAG pipelines, essential for semantic search and retrieval augmentation. |
| `/src/llm_api` | FastAPI or microservice endpoints for executing LLM-related operations, cheats, and intelligent task delegation. |
| `/src/session_management` | Manages session persistence and states across Redis, PostgreSQL, or vector databases. Ensures robust agent memory and continuity. |
| `/src/observability` | Centralized telemetry and monitoring setup using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Celery for metrics, tracing, and task visualization. |
| `/src/utils` | Common helper scripts, encoding/decoding functions, regex validators, and synchronization utilities supporting all ALN subsystems. |
| `/src/resources` | Storage for static, versioned YAML definitions, pretrained embeddings, and model manifest files. |
| `/src/assets` | Optional parallel directory for non-critical static assets such as config images or auxiliary resources. |
| `/tests` | Unit and integration test suites for all core modules, fully compatible with `pytest`, and integrated with code coverage and CI checks. |
| `/docs` | Developer documentation, architecture blueprints, ALN command specs, and both deployment and contributor guidelines. |

### Ecosystem Advantages

- Promotes modularity and discoverability, ensuring every submodule can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.  
- Enables fast debugging and monitoring via clean observability and deployment layers.  
- Scales efficiently for hybrid-agent ecosystems by supporting additional extensions like `/frontend` (UI), `/scripts` (automation), or `/agents_registry`.  
- Aligns with **Agents.md+2** compliance standards and is battle-tested for large distributed systems requiring autonomous agent communication.
