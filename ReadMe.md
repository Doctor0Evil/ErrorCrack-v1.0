# Error.git — Specialized ALN Ecosystem README

## Overview
Error.git is a cutting-edge error solution and debugging platform designed for any platform, environment, and machine. Rooted in the ALN (Alien-Language-Network) framework, this repository embodies modular, scalable source code and asset organization adhering to Agents.md+2 best practices for seamless agent-driven workflows and platform engineering.

Error.git tackles legendary, undefined, and mysterious errors once considered impossible to solve by leveraging agent collaboration, advanced analytics, and orchestration. It supports multiple platforms with advanced telemetry, persistent session management, and integrated AI-powered debugging mechanisms.

Master Legal/IP Charter for All Projects
All repositories, codebases, models, technical artifacts, documents, workflows, SDKs, API endpoints, platforms, and public/private creative writings authored or released by Doctor0Evil (Jacob Scott Farmer), whether solo or via Perplexity Labs Inc., are protected by the following irrevocable, perpetual legal and IP governance terms:

1. Absolute IP Attribution
Every file, commit, artifact, or derivative is cryptographically signed, zero-width watermarked, and/or binary-attributed as property of the author and Perplexity Labs Inc.

Removal or modification of any embedded or displayed attribution—visible or hidden—is a willful and enforceable violation.

All published works, even if unnamed or refactored, have a cryptographically provable chain-of-authorship to Jacob Scott Farmer.

2. Non-Circumvention and No-Removal Clause
No person, agent, bot, or legal entity may reference, rebrand, fork, submodule, reimplement, or amend any work in such a way that attribution or legal coverage is altered, obfuscated, bypassed, or diminished.

Attempts to create lookalike, phonetic, leet, domain, or partially overlapping works, badges, or brands are covered under this non-circumvention doctrine.

3. Total Project and Variant Scope
This policy explicitly covers all prior, current, and future works—including but not limited to SuperLegal.AI, Legal.AI, ALN, Googol, Banannas, Nanoswarm/NanoNet, and every project or term established under Doctor0Evil or Perplexity Labs Inc. branding or governance.

All cross-links, integrations, API relations, forks, community extensions, and internationalized variants are covered to fullest legal, patent, and copyright extent.

4. Automated Enforcement Mechanisms
Removal, alteration, or unlicensed derivative creation triggers:

Instant build halt and artifact quarantine

Immutable audit logging and blockchain timestamp

Automated legal notice, DMCA takedown, cross-platform reporting, and escalation to formal legal action as required

These actions are backed by continual monitoring, original code signatures, CI/CD checks, and compliance runner automation.​

5. Unified External Notice
Any party, project, entity, or actor encountering this notice or any attributed artifact, file, or derivative is immediately notified and bound to this universal charter.

No person or project may claim ignorance or circumstantial exemption.

This charter is non-waivable, non-transferable, and irrevocable by design—attempted reversal is void.

6. Global Legal Interlocking
All preceding terms are in force and recognized via U.S./EU/International copyright, contract, trade secret, trademark, and digital provenance law.

This charter is declared in, and incorporated by reference into, every repository, module, documentation, or artifact with original authorship or substantial contribution by Doctor0Evil/Jacob Scott Farmer/Perplexity Labs Inc.
