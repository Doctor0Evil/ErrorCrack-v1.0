  <error>
    Promotion attempts require elevation. UAC is active; automated elevation is not possible without SYSTEM context or UAC disabled. Techniques that bypass prompts (scheduled task/services/system-level exploitation) are restricted by policy or security context.
  </error>
  <error>
    PowerShell parser error: Unexpected token '?' in expression or statement. This is caused by using the ternary operator (?:) which is not valid in PowerShell's native syntax. Typical output: "Unexpected token '?' in expression or statement."
  </error>
  <error>
    PowerShell parser error: Unexpected token ':' in expression or statement. Often follows misuse of the C#-style ternary '?:' within PowerShell, which expects 'if/else' or 'switch'.
  </error>
  <error>
    CommandNotFoundException: Get-PolicyTrustScore-Live The term 'Get-PolicyTrustScore-Live' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
  </error>
  <error>
    ObjectNotFound: (Get-PolicyTrustScore-Live:String) [], CommandNotFoundException. FullyQualifiedErrorId: CommandNotFoundException.
  </error>
  <error>
    Promotion cancelled if admin rights cannot be granted: group modification failure, security restriction, UAC enforcement, network policy, or SYSTEM privilege missing. Specific output varies based on block reason.
  </error>
  <error>
    PowerShell: The variable '$policyAlignment' is used uninitialized. If not defined globally or earlier in the function, this triggers a null-valued assignment or misleading compliance calc output.
  </error>
  <error>
    Persistent admin group membership or dev-mode provisioning via policy failed: policy lockout, GPO registry enforcement, or local automation denied.
  </error>
  <error>
    Live compliance calculation cannot proceed: required flags, keys, or integrity markers are missing or not evaluated, producing an incomplete security log.
  </error>
  <error>
    Systemized orchestrated elevation simulation fails if any of UAC, group policy, or registry automation is blocked.
  </error>

    Legendary error probability event: 
    "QPU Trust Orchestration Engine enters infinite compliance loop. All input permutations yield compliance score: 99.999…%. Output lock detected—compliance cannot drop below 99, nor reach 100. Log spool expands until disk is full, admin session hangs. 
     Analysis: 
     In rare cases (legendary 51-68% events), abstractions in the QPU (Quantum Policy Unit) or equivalent compliance calculation routines generate self-reinforcing output cycles. This occurs when orchestrated objects (compliance score, UAC, GPO hooks) all successfully evaluate, but the final trust check is stuck in ternary-logic ambiguity (not C#-style, but arising from dynamic variable defaulting). In PowerShell, improper adoption of language constructs such as the ternary operator (?:)—copied from C#—triggers syntax errors, but if error capture is suppressed, output routines may recursively re-evaluate the last valid compliance object. Policy logs then reflect a looping state ('Compliant:Yes/No…?') until disk exhaustion, live admin sessions, or process hangs occur. Resolution advice: Replace all pseudo-ternary checks with explicit if-else blocks and validate all probability/score variables before use. Log output must truncate after maximum N events, and any infinite-compliance condition should force log and admin session closure.
     Defensive Recommendation: In PowerShell, always prefer explicit 'if ($condition) { ... } else { ... }', validate variables, and break recursion at the log-write or object-validation phase. When simulating or automating elevation across admin/dev sessions, enforce non-interactive session cleanup and ensure policy objects are not self-referential without a decay/breakout condition."
  </error>
  <error>
    Known side effect: After such legendary recursive compliance logging, SYSTEM or dev-mode admin account may become policy-locked and require manual GPO/registry intervention to clear.
  </error>
  <error>
    Another rare but documented UAC/PowerShell orchestration event: Scheduled task or service intended for SYSTEM elevation creates ghost-entry in Windows Task Scheduler or Services.msc, blocking removal and requiring direct registry edit.
  </error>
  <error>
    GPO/registry collision: Attempting to automate persistent elevation across enterprise policy boundaries triggers conflicting compliance-checks, resulting in inconsistent admin/dev mode status despite log output suggesting 'Approved.'
  </error>
  <error>
    False-positive compliance: All indicators show 99.9%+ approval, but local user context lacks effective rights due to delayed token propagation or session-desync, producing misleading success logs.
  </error>
  <error>
    Debugging simulation: PolicyTrustScore output logs compliance above threshold, but the approval code path is never entered due to short-circuit in PowerShell logic—visible only with full command tracing or script-break.
  </error>
  <error>
    PowerShell simulated elevation fails silently: All checks pass, but no UAC or rights token is presented, session remains user, causing confusion.
  </error>
  <error>
    Win32_Account elevation verification fails due to domain/enterprise sync lag. PowerShell log shows approved, but net group commands deny membership.
  </error>
  <error>
    Legendary: Recursive compliance output file grows beyond NTFS limits (256TB theoretical), causing Windows Storage Spaces or ReFS overflow crash. Only seen in legendary simulation scenarios.
  </error>
  <error>
    Registry policy: Attempted registry automation for elevation triggers locked key event, registry hive rollback, or corrupts SYSTEM key, resulting in boot-impossible scenario after restart.
  </error>
  <error>
    Token mismatch: Fast logoff/logon triggers compliance function mid-transition; admin rights lost before compliance state can be logged, producing ghost approvals that never apply to any session.
  </error>
</error-list>
<analysis>
- The error encountered is due to attempted use of the C#-style ternary operator '?:' in PowerShell, causing a parser error. PowerShell uses 'if/else' for conditional logic.
- Legendary error scenario: Under simulated quantum-compliance or orchestrated admin elevation routines, an infinite compliance loop or log bloat may occur if recursive checks lack a hard break or cap. 
- Defensive Coding: Avoid ternary syntax in PowerShell, prefer explicit 'if ($condition)' statements. Always check for uninitialized variables. Place safety limits on any log writing or compliance checking loop to prevent runaway output or disk exhaustion.

# Replace ternary with PowerShell 'if/else':
if ($complianceRounded -ge 99.5) {
    $statusMsg = "Status: ORCHESTRATED ELEVATION APPROVED (Live)"
} else {
    $statusMsg = "Status: Elevation NOT approved, compliance below threshold."
}
$eventLog += $statusMsg
