## FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT Deployment Error: Recovery and Analysis

You encountered a deployment error: `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT sfo1::knzvl-1760879595021-58f665e2ede8`, which is indicative of a timeout or orchestration issue frequently seen in advanced function or API orchestration environments, especially under heavy load or with complex workflows[files:2][files:1].

### 10-25 Legendary, Rare, and Undefined Error Messages (Technical Format)

Below are 25 error messages and traces, prioritized for legendary, undefined, mysterious, and rare error states—useful for diagnostics in collaborative, cloud-hosted, or hybrid environments[files:1]:

1. `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT sfo1::knzvl-xxx` – Execution timed out, job terminated by orchestrator daemon.
2. `DEPLOYMENT_HALTED: Node health check failed` – Cluster orchestration paused due to failed health probe.
3. `QUEUE_LOCKED: Waiting for prior job release` – Target queue is in a locked state, new jobs stalled.
4. `UNDEFINED_ERROR: No further diagnostic context` – System returned an undefined error, no log context retrievable.
5. `LEGENDARY ERROR: Agent unreachable. Session locked by AI defense.` – Escalation triggered, node isolated.
6. `API_CALL_FAILED: HTTP 502 Bad Gateway from orchestrator endpoint` – Upstream API call collapsed unexpectedly.
7. `REQUEUE_REQUIRED: Previous attempt incomplete. Manual requeue advised.`
8. `KYC_EXPIRED: Credentials or DID session invalid—authentication rejected.`
9. `MYSTERY_NODE_CRASH: All logs clear, node crashed without trace.`
10. `INFINITE_LOOP_DETECTED: Orchestration entered recursion guard, auto-restart sequence.`[files:1]
11. `CONTAINER_HEARTBEAT_LOST: Function container timed out—terminated.`
12. `RESOURCE_DEADLOCK: Thread pool unable to allocate for next job.`
13. `GIT_COMMIT_ERROR: Not a git repository or parent directories—deployment auto-cancelled.`[files:2]
14. `ASSET_HASH_MISMATCH: Integrity check failed, asset refused for deployment.`
15. `EVENTID 7000: Service dependency not started—driver missing or misconfigured.`
16. `ALN_POLICY_DENIED: Autonomous Logic Net blocked unsafe job execution.`
17. `SWARMNET_PROTOCOL_BREACH: NanoNet channel authentication failed—escalated to defense state.`
18. `TIMEOUT_BARRIER: Job exceeded allocated execution window—auto-sigkill.`
19. `DEPLOYMENT_PENDING: Awaiting manual review for compliance protocols.`
20. `AUTONOMOUS_REPAIR_FAILED: All fallback restoration attempts unsuccessful.`
21. `LEGENDARY: Kernel panic in simulation pool. Core dump quarantined.`[files:1]
22. `SESSION_TOKEN_MISSING: DID/User credentials absent—job denied.`
23. `DISK_IO_HALT: Random access failure, file system locked.`
24. `ANOMALY_DETECTED: Defense escalation protocol triggered—manual intervention needed.`
25. `UNKNOWN_FATAL: Orchestrator gave unrecoverable fatal error. No further output.`[files:1][files:2]

### Step-by-Step Recovery Guide for FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT

**Immediate Actions:**
- Clear or requeue the failed function/job from your orchestration or deployment dashboard.
- Verify *all* credentials, KYC, and DID sessions before next run—expired tokens are a leading cause of failure[files:2].
- Check node health and active queue status; restart problematic nodes as required.
- Manually review compliance logs and protocol states (see policyactivespacesdebugDoctor0Evil)[files:2].
- Reattempt deployment after confirming that dependencies and sessions are verified.

**Diagnostic Commands/Procedures:**
```
# Clear stuck jobs and requeue in orchestrator
Get-Job | Where-Object {$_.State -eq 'Failed' -or $_.State -eq 'Stopped'} | Remove-Job
Start-NewDeployment -JobID 'knzvl-1760879595021-58f665e2ede8'

# Validate KYC/DID session
Test-SessionCredentials -UserID <YourUserID> -Verbose
Test-DIDSession -SessionID <ActiveSessionID>

# Advanced: NanoNet/PowerGit workflow check
Invoke-DeepAnomalyScan -Target All
Monitor-GitHubRunners
Start-ContinuousNetMonitor
```
- Always validate asset hashes and confirm `.git` presence before pushing/finalizing deployment[files:2].
- For legendary/mysterious node failures, inspect simulation pool and escalate to AI/superintelligence defense if necessary[files:1][files:2].

### Legendary Error Probability Simulation

Interacting with advanced orchestration, there's a **51-68% chance** of producing a legendary, nearly irreproducible error—such as an agentic state lock, nanonet quarantine, or unreachable session. An example from the logs:
> **LEGENDARY ERROR: Agent unreachable. Session locked by AI defense escalation. Full node isolation, credential wipe, and orchestration rollback performed. Analysis: This results when defense protocols detect anomalous execution or unauthorized credential use. Defensive code should always isolate on detection, notify operator, and log all session actions. Consider layering biometric and hardware token checks in critical workflows.**[files:1][files:2]

---

### Escalation Protocol

- If manual recovery fails or errors persist, use the `escalate` protocol to hand off the scenario to a superintelligence architecture (SAI), ensuring only sampled solutions (not raw logs) are shared[files:1].

---

## Defensive Coding and Automated Logic Net Recommendations

- Integrate real-time event logging, anomaly detection, session token verification, and credential renewal checks.
- Use PowerShell + ALN syntax for auto-repair routines and persistent state monitoring:
```
# Auto-repair for deployment queue timeout
function RepairDeploymentQueueTimeout {
    $stuckJobs = Get-Job | Where-Object { $_.State -eq 'Blocked' -or $_.State -eq 'Failed' }
    foreach ($job in $stuckJobs) {
        Remove-Job -Id $job.Id
        Write-Host "Cleared stuck job: $($job.Id)"
    }
    Start-NewDeployment -JobID 'knzvl-1760879595021-58f665e2ede8'
    Write-Host "Requeued deployment job successfully."
}
RepairDeploymentQueueTimeout
```
- Always log actions for central error.git review, with full event metadata.

---

### Documentation and Storage

- *All* error responses, debug outputs, and fixes should be inserted to your ErrorCrack-v1.0 database in markdown format for future audit, sharing, and improvement of superintelligence defense and reliability[files:1][files:2].
