## Directory Creation Error Resolution & Diagnostics

This PowerShell script provides an automated solution for resolving directory creation errors during deployment, listing files in `C:\Users\Hunter\error.git`, recursively creating missing folders, verifying user permissions, and logging errors for all file operations[files:2][web:10].

### PowerShell Script: Legendary Directory Fixer & Error Logger

```
# Resolve directory creation errors and log all actions
$deployRoot = "$env:USERPROFILE\error.git\ErrorCrack-v1.0\deployment"
$baseDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\error.git"
$errorLog = "$env:USERPROFILE\PowerGit-Security\directory-error.log"

function Write-ErrorLog {
    param ($msg)
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    Add-Content -Path $errorLog -Value "[$timestamp] $msg"
}

# 1. List existing files inside the error.git directory
if (Test-Path $baseDir -PathType Container) {
    Write-Host "`n-- Existing Files in $baseDir --"
    Get-ChildItem -Path $baseDir -Force | ForEach-Object {
        Write-Host $_.FullName
    }
} else {
    Write-ErrorLog "Base directory $baseDir NOT found or not a directory."
    Write-Host "Base directory does not exist; create it first."
    try {
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $baseDir -Force
        Write-ErrorLog "Created missing base directory: $baseDir"
    } catch {
        Write-ErrorLog "ERROR: Failed to create base directory: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        throw
    }
}

# 2. Create missing folders recursively before writing files
try {
    if (!(Test-Path $deployRoot -PathType Container)) {
        New-Item -Path $deployRoot -ItemType Directory -Force
        Write-ErrorLog "Created missing deployment directory: $deployRoot"
    }
} catch {
    Write-ErrorLog "ERROR: Failed to create deployment directory: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    throw
}

# 3. Verify user permissions to create directories and files
try {
    $permTestFile = Join-Path $deployRoot "_permTest.txt"
    Set-Content -Path $permTestFile -Value "Permission test â€” $(Get-Date)"
    Remove-Item -Path $permTestFile -Force
    Write-ErrorLog "Permission test succeeded in $deployRoot."
} catch {
    Write-ErrorLog "ERROR: Permission denied in $deployRoot: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    throw
}

# 4. Create files, logging any error
$testFiles = @("legendary.log", "function_test.txt", "diagnostic.md")
foreach ($file in $testFiles) {
    $targetPath = Join-Path $deployRoot $file
    try {
        Set-Content -Path $targetPath -Value "# Created $file at $targetPath"
        Write-ErrorLog "Created file: $targetPath"
    } catch {
        Write-ErrorLog "ERROR: Failed to create file $targetPath: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        throw
    }
}

Write-Host "`nAll directory and file operations completed. Check $errorLog for errors and results."
```

### Script Behavior & Diagnostic Features

- Lists all files and folders in the target directory before any operation, providing visibility into existing state.
- Recursively creates missing directories prior to file operations, including complex, multilevel deployment paths.
- Verifies user permissions by safely writing and cleaning up a test file, logging any failures.
- Logs all errors and critical events to a central log file (`directory-error.log`) for troubleshooting legendary errors and permission issues.
- Stops and surfaces any unfixable legendary errors, ensuring forensic traceability[files:2][web:10].

---

### Operator Notes

- Run script with administrative or required user privileges to guarantee full access to parent directories.
- For persistent DirectoryNotFoundException, check for file/folder name conflicts, system locks, or legacy file presence at parent deployment path.
- Review error logs after script execution for actionable diagnostics and next steps.

**Use this script to automate error resolution, audit directory state, and ensure safe provisioning for all future PowerGit or ErrorCrack-v1.0 deployments.**
