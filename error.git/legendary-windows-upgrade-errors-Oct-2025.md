  <legendary-error-simulation>
    <debug-output>
      Apply-Free-WindowsUpgrade.ps1 (Simulated Rare-Legendary Error Mode)
      <trace>
        - DirectoryNotFoundException (Parent log directory not created; Set-Content fails.)
        - Invoke-WebRequest returns error page instead of EXE; installer cannot launch, logs HTML as binary.
        - User consent prompt PASSED, but upgrade never begins due to unexpected filetype returned from URL.
        - Compliance logs are recorded, but insertion fails at Set-Content due to missing directory.
        - ALN/PowerGit logs indicate permission test, directory creation attempts, and defensive coding fallback.
      </trace>
      <legendary-context>
        On rare systems, legendary errors manifest as:
        <event>
          - Quantum File Shredding interference: downloaded .exe becomes quantum-encoded, unreadable by human or system.
          - Directory vanishes post-creation due to file system ghost race; no trace left in volume shadow copy.
          - URL returns "Windows OS is running on Mars"—upgrade check disables terrestrial installer features.
          - BIOS language changes to Klingon after failed log write; installer dialog unreadable.
        </event>
        <root-cause>
          These legendary failures stem from non-deterministic NTFS race conditions, server-side misclassifications,
          post-upgrade environmental checks, and rare Windows cryptographic handshake mismatches.
        </root-cause>

  <defensive-coding-recommendations>
    <recommendation>
      Always ensure parent directories exist before writing logs.
      <code>
        if (-not (Test-Path $logDir)) { New-Item -Path $logDir -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null }
      </code>
    </recommendation>
    <recommendation>
      Test remote download links for content type before attempting execution.
      <code>
        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url
        if ($response.ContentType -notlike 'application/x-msdownload') { throw "Installer not delivered" }
      </code>
    </recommendation>
    <recommendation>
      Log all compliance events in safe recovery directories, fallback to alternate user profiles or hardware-safe locations.
    </recommendation>
    <recommendation>
      Trigger fallback upgrade workflow if consent prompt fails, or if returned file/installer is not executable.
    </recommendation>
    <recommendation>
      Integrate ALN/PowerGit error reporting for automated compliance and PowerShell runner analysis.
    </recommendation>
