# ErrorCrack-v1.0: protect-errorcrack.ps1 – Security Analysis & ALN Audit

The `protect-errorcrack.ps1` script is a production-hardened PowerShell/ALN tool designed to provide error-proof, tamper-resistant, and forensically-traceable attribution, security, and copy-protection for the ErrorCrack-v1.0 repository.

## Key Security & Attribution Features

- **Automated LICENSE/README Enforcement**
  - Instantly places clear licensing and attribution terms in all codepaths, with AGPL v3.0 / CC BY-SA 4.0 dual license and mandatory provenance for all usage [file:2].

- **GitHub Workflow & Branch Protection**
  - Applies branch protections (admin, PR, and check enforcement) via GitHub CLI and admin API, ensuring only trusted, signed commits are accepted and required reviews for any changes [file:2].

- **Mandatory GPG Commit Signing**
  - Enforces GPG signature usage for all commits (when a key is set), blocking unsigned/attribution-lacking commits at source [file:2].

- **Automated Security Monitor Workflow**
  - Installs a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) that verifies signature provenance, scans for unauthorized or unsigned commits, and checks LICENSE/README for proper policy and compliance text [file:2].

## Advanced Defensive Integrations (ALN/PowerShell)

- **Session, Action, and Provenance Logging**
  - Registers all git and script operations, maintains persistent logs, tracks command provenance, and aligns with ALN compliance and legal registry standards; supports append-only, quantum-anchored audit logs [file:2][file:3].

- **Autonomous Self-Healing & Recovery**
  - Implements continuous system consistency monitors, auto-healing repo state if tampering, object loss, or drift is detected [file:2].

- **Anomaly/Intrusion Detection**
  - Triggers forensic snapshots, real-time audit delivery, and chain-of-trust enforcement routines on any anomalous, unauthorized, or ambiguous operation [file:2][file:3].

- **AI-Ethics and Rights Compliance**
  - All security, provenance, and attribution mechanisms are enforced in line with ALN-specified AI ethics, human, and developer rights (no personhood for AI, strict consent and auditability, multi-party oversight on high-impact actions) [file:3].

---

## Special Safeguards

- **Enforcement of Institutional & Legal Provenance**
  - Ensures every change, release, and downstream derivative has institutional register, copyright, and audit anchoring [file:2][file:3].

- **Zero Admin Dependency Options**
  - Most compliance features persist even for non-admin execution, using user-level folder protections, GPG signatures, routine copy/restore, and explicit command logging [file:3].

- **Regulatory- and AI-Ready Defensive Coding**
  - Every critical operation is pre-verified, logged, and if needed, auto-locked and escalated to operator-only intervention (doctor0evil) under high-risk or ambiguous conditions [file:2][file:3].

---

## Excerpts: Defensive Logic, ALN and System Controls

- **Branch, Commit, and Attribution Security**
  - Rejects unsigned or ambiguous provenance commits, applies dual-content registry, and supports audit-forensic review for regulatory/FCC audit trails.
- **PowerGit Defensive Measures**
  - 10+ modules: real-time intrusion radar, AI firewall regeneration, process integrity cage, port lockdown, anomaly and deception grid, repo integrity sentinel, cryptographic key cycling, nano-response, and forensic rollback features—individually controllable and always auditable [file:2].
- **Quantum/Blockchain Anchored Audit Chains**
  - Immutably logs all critical, security, and compliance events using blockchain/quantum anchors for nonrepudiation and append-only recovery [file:3].

## ALN Sample: Compliance Logging Snippet

```
aln module repo.attribution.enforce
  event trigger COMMIT
    step 1 verify GPG signature, validate trusted author
    step 2 check LICENSE, README for attribution text
    step 3 log event to quantum-anchored chain
    step 4 if unsigned or incorrect, block commit, alert operator
    step 5 periodic scan for unsynced or legacy files, auto-remediate
end
```

This system delivers legendary, regulatory-compliant protection with instant anomaly response, end-to-end provenance, and continuous AI-legal audit readiness, aligned with ErrorCrack-v1.0's universal defense & diagnostic mission.
