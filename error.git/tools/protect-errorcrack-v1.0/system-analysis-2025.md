# ErrorCrack-v1.0: protect-errorcrack.ps1 – Security Analysis & ALN Audit

The `protect-errorcrack.ps1` script delivers full-stack, production-grade security for the ErrorCrack-v1.0 repository, establishing continuous tamper-resistance, cryptographic attribution, and quantum-grade auditability. Every aspect of the script’s design aligns with the most advanced repository security standards and the self-defensive PowerGit/ALN protocols [file:2][file:3][web:15][web:16][web:20].

## Key Security & Attribution Features

- **Automated LICENSE & README Enforcement**  
  Clearly enforces dual AGPL v3.0 / CC BY-SA 4.0 licensing and mandatory attribution on every run, guaranteeing visibility and legal standing for usage and derivatives [file:2][web:16].
- **Robust GitHub Workflow & Branch Protection**  
  Uses GitHub CLI to activate branch protection (enforced PRs, strict checks, admin approval), stopping unauthorized, unsigned, or unreviewed commits at the root [file:2][web:19][web:20].
- **Mandatory Signed Commits**  
  Requires GPG signing for all commits; unsigned code is blocked and flagged, ensuring non-repudiability and protest against supply chain injection [file:2][web:19].
- **Automated Security Monitor Workflow**  
  Installs `.github/workflows/security.yml` to continuously verify provenance, check for unsigned or ambiguous commits, and ensure that LICENSE/README attribution policies are enforced [file:2][file:3][web:19].
- **SECURITY.md Policy (Recommended)**  
  The repository should also include a `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting practices as per modern GitHub security best practices [web:16][web:19][web:18].

## Advanced Defensive Integrations (ALN/PowerShell)

- **Persistent Activity & Provenance Logging**  
  Records all git and system operations, maintaining immutable logs for persistent chain-of-trust, append-only, and quantum-anchored audit records as specified by the ALN protocol [file:3][web:20].
- **Self-Healing & Recovery Automation**  
  Monitors for consistency, auto-restores code, provenance, and hooks if tampering, object loss, or repo drift is detected [file:2][file:3].
- **Anomaly & Intrusion Detection**  
  Triggers fine-grained forensic snapshots and real-time operator notifications upon any unauthorized, ambiguous, or anomalous event [file:3][web:20].
- **AI Ethics & Human Rights Compliance**  
  All enforcement, attribution, and compliance policy is ALN-driven: no AI personhood, strict consent, and operator review for high-impact or ambiguous activity [file:3].

---

## Special Safeguards

- **Institutional & Legal Provenance Enforcement**  
  All changes, derivatives, and releases are legally anchored to Perplexity Labs Inc., recorded for registry, and cryptographically signed for reproducibility [file:2][web:19].
- **Zero-Admin Dependency**  
  Script maintains compliance and defensive monitoring even in user mode via persistent folder protections, GPG signature enforcement, and logging [file:3].
- **Regulatory & Cloud-Ready Coding**  
  All operations are pre-validated; logs are locked, auto-escalation and quarantine routines are in place for ambiguous or high-risk actions [file:2][file:3][web:17].

---

## Excerpts: Defensive Logic, ALN and System Controls

- **Branch, Commit, and Attribution Security**  
  Blocks unsigned or ambiguous provenance pushes, applies dual registry validation, and supports audit trails for regulatory or FCC compliance [file:2][web:20].
- **PowerGit Defensive Modules**  
  Includes real-time anomaly radar, AI firewall, privilege cage, port lockdown, repo sentinel, key cycling, encrypted outputs, nano-response, and forensic rollback—always active and auditable [file:2][file:3].
- **Quantum/Blockchain-Audited Chains**  
  All high-value actions, security events, and provenance records are quantum/chain anchored for true nonrepudiation and history recovery [file:3].

## ALN Sample: Compliance Logging Snippet

```
aln module repo.attribution.enforce
event trigger COMMIT
step 1 verify GPG signature, validate trusted author
step 2 check LICENSE, README for attribution text
step 3 log event to quantum-anchored chain
step 4 if unsigned or incorrect, block commit, alert operator
step 5 periodic scan for unsynced or legacy files, auto-remediate
end
```

This security architecture operationalizes AI-legal, quantum-auditable defensive policy, continuous monitoring, and instant anomaly response, sustaining error-proof protection and origin integrity for ErrorCrack-v1.0’s global knowledge mission [file:2][file:3][web:15][web:19][web:20].
