## Catalog & Debug Simulation Output

### Top 25 Upgrade-Related Legendary Errors

| Error | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) | Fatal stop codes—cryptic hardware references. Sometimes required new motherboard, advanced diagnostics. |
| Abort, Retry, Fail? (MS-DOS) | Legendary floppy/disk error. User unable to recover due to mysterious decisions. No useful diagnostics. |
| WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR | Hardware fault loop. Endless reboot; could only fix by swapping components. Kernel-level bug. |
| Explorer.exe Unrepairable Bug (Win11) | No fix available even from Microsoft; File Explorer never launches. |
| DirectoryNotFoundException | Directory does not exist—often due to missing or unsynced parent.<br>`Sample:` Could not find a part of the path 'C:\Users\Hunter\error.git\ExecutionLog-20251019.txt'. |
| Invoke-WebRequest Returns HTML/CSS Error Page Instead of Installer | Occurs when expected EXE download is replaced by a generic error page. Windows 10/11 upgrades fail or result in corrupted installer execution. |
| Windows Cannot Find Filename | Registry/path corruption—impossible to fix even after reinstall. |
| Disk Boot Failure—Insert System Disk | MBR corruption, drive undetectable by BIOS. |
| NTLDR is Missing | Essential bootloader file missing; unfixable without disk recovery or clean install. |
| Error Code 0x80070057 | 'The parameter is incorrect.' Recurring during backup, install, update; root cause unclear. |
| System Restore Points Disappearing | All restore points vanish after update—no recovery option. |
| Frequent, Unfixable File Corruption | NTFS/SSD randomly corrupts data, triggers reinstall/new hardware. |
| Catastrophic Failure | Installer or Office application crashes fatally, no diagnostic provided. |

### Legendary Error Simulation Output

**Apply-Free-WindowsUpgrade.ps1 (Simulated Rare-Legendary Error Mode)**
- DirectoryNotFoundException (Parent log directory not created; Set-Content fails.)
- Invoke-WebRequest returns error page instead of EXE; installer cannot launch, logs HTML as binary.
- User consent prompt PASSED, but upgrade never begins due to unexpected filetype returned from URL.
- Compliance logs are recorded, but insertion fails at Set-Content due to missing directory.
- ALN/PowerGit logs indicate permission test, directory creation attempts, and defensive coding fallback.

**Legendary Event Trace Context**
- Quantum File Shredding: downloaded .exe becomes quantum-encoded, unreadable by human or system.
- Directory vanishes post-creation due to file system ghost race; no trace left in volume shadow copy.
- URL returns "Windows OS is running on Mars"—upgrade check disables terrestrial installer features.
- BIOS language switches to Klingon following log write failure; installer dialog unreadable.

#### Root Cause Profile
These legendary failures stem from non-deterministic NTFS race conditions, server-side misclassifications, post-upgrade environment checks, and rare Windows cryptographic handshake mismatches.

### Defensive Coding Recommendations

- Always ensure parent directories exist before writing logs.
  if (-not (Test-Path $logDir)) { New-Item -Path $logDir -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null }
- Test remote download links for content type before attempting execution.
  $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url
  if ($response.ContentType -notlike 'application/x-msdownload') { throw "Installer not delivered" }
- Log compliance events in safe recovery directories, fallback to hardware-safe alternate profiles.
- Trigger fallback upgrade workflow if consent fails or returned file/installer is not executable.
- Integrate ALN/PowerGit error reporting for automated compliance and runner analysis.

### Legendary Event Annotation

- Probability of legendary error occurrence during upgrade simulation: 54% [randomized per-run].
- Each legendary error trace archived includes >300 characters with root cause and annotation.
